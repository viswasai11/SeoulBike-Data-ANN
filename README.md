# SeoulBike-Data-Artificial-Neural-Network

## Overview
This project utilizes Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) to predict bike rental demand in Seoul, South Korea. The ANN model is trained on the Seoulbike dataset, which contains various features related to weather, time, and date, aiming to forecast the number of bike rentals.

## Dataset Overview
The Seoulbike dataset contains the following variables:


|**Column**|**Description**|
|-------|-------|
|Date| Date of the record.|
|Rented Bike Count| The number of rented bikes in a given hour.|
|Hour| Hour of the day.|
|Temperature| Temperature in Celsius.|
|Humidity| Humidity level.|
|Wind Speed| Wind speed in m/s.|
|Visibility| Visibility in meters.|
|Dew Point Temperature| Dew point temperature in Celsius.|
|Solar Radiation| Solar radiation in MegaJoules/m^2.|
|Rainfall| Amount of rainfall in mm.|
|Snowfall| Amount of snowfall in cm.|
|Seasons| Season of the year (Spring, Summer, Autumn, Winter).|
|Holiday| Whether it's a holiday (Yes/No).|
|Functioning Day| Whether it's a functioning day (Yes/No).|

## Results
Provided information about the model's performance, such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) or other relevant metrics, on a test dataset. Included visualizations or graphs that help interpret the results.
